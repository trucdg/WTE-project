BU username: trucdg
a. URL: https://cs-people.bu.edu/trucdg/cs103/final-project/
b. I created my own HTML and CSS. However, I used a CSS hover effect template for the navigation bar on the Homepage
c. The URL to the CSS template of the hover effect: https://codepen.io/kiran-r-raj/pen/poRGMPa
d. Interactive Feature requirement using JS toolkits provided by others: 
 - On the Homepage of my website, I used typeIt to embed dynamically typed texts. The text is to prompt users to hover
 over the displayed thumbnail pictures.

 - On the Restaurant page:
	+ I used the geolocation feature of the browser to obtaine user's location, used alert() to print out a prompt asking
	permission to access user's current location. If access is denied, the location will be set to BU's geo coordinates.
	+ I used GoogleMapAPI to embed a dynamic and interactive map centered at user's location or a default location.
	+ I used GoogleMap Places API and its library to obtain the information of 3 restaurants which are nearest to the
	user and within 5km of the user's location. 
	+ I used Autocomplete feature of GoogleMapAPI to create the autocomplete dropdown on the input of location.
 - On the Recipe page:
	+ I added a Google Search Engine and enhanced search results by adding the keyword "food" and "recipe" into the search feature.
	Thus, user only need to type in keywords, i.e chicken, then the results will contain chicken recipe related pages.
 - On the FoodFeed page:
	+ I created and added Instagram Feeds provided by Juicer. I linked the media source to my instagram account and added
	the hashtags: #bostonfood, #foodie (for pictures) and also instagram #food reels (to get videos posts). 
	I set the daily number of posts to 60, and new posts will be updated daily. 
e. Interactive Feature requirement using JS coding from scratch:
 - On the Homepage:  
	+ I created the imgSlider() function to change the food image in the header when the user hover over
 	one of the three displayed thumbnail pictures.
